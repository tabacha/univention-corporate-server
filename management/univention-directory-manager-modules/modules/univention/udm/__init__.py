Univention Directory Manager Modules (UDM) API

This is a simplified API for accessing UDM objects.
It consists of UDM modules and UDM object.
UDM modules are factories for UDM objects.
UDM objects manipulate LDAP objects.

Usage:

from univention.udm import Udm

user_mod = Udm.using_admin().get('users/user')

obj = user_mod.get(dn)
obj.props.firstname = 'foo'  # modify property
obj.position = 'cn=users,cn=example,dc=com'  # move LDAP object
obj.save()  # apply changes

obj = user_mod.get(dn)
obj.delete()

obj = user_mod.new()
obj.props.username = 'bar'
obj.save().refresh()  # reload obj.props from LDAP after save()

for obj in user_mod.search('uid=a*'):  # search() returns a generator
	print(obj.props.firstname, obj.props.lastname)
