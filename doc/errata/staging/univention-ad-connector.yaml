fix: 12.0.0-26A~4.3.0.201810162103
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The tool univention-adsearch now also uses the file containing the full
   certificate chain instead of only the exported AD certificate alone.
 * The package univention-ad-connector-exchange did reset specific UCR
   variable values to their default during the update. This has been
   adjusted to keep customer adjusted values untouched.
