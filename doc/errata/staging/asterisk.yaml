fix: 1:13.14.1~dfsg-2+deb9u4
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk through 13.19.1, 14.x
   through 14.7.5, and 15.x through 15.2.1, and Certified Asterisk through
   13.18-cert2. When processing a SUBSCRIBE request, the res_pjsip_pubsub
   module stores the accepted formats present in the Accept headers of the
   request. This code did not limit the number of headers it processed,
   despite having a fixed limit of 32. If more than 32 Accept headers were
   present, the code would write outside of its memory and cause a crash.
   (CVE-2018-7284)
 * An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 13.19.1, 14.x through 14.7.5,
   and 15.x through 15.2.1, and Certified Asterisk through 13.18-cert2.
   res_pjsip allows remote authenticated users to crash Asterisk (segmentation
   fault) by sending a number of SIP INVITE messages on a TCP or TLS
   connection and then suddenly closing the connection. (CVE-2018-7286)
 * An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.21.1, 14.x
   before 14.7.7, and 15.x before 15.4.1 and Certified Asterisk 13.18-cert
   before 13.18-cert4 and 13.21-cert before 13.21-cert2. When endpoint
   specific ACL rules block a SIP request, they respond with a 403 forbidden.
   However, if an endpoint is not identified, then a 401 unauthorized response
   is sent. This vulnerability just discloses which requests hit a defined
   endpoint. The ACL rules cannot be bypassed to gain access to the disclosed
   endpoints. (CVE-2018-12227)
 * There is a stack consumption vulnerability in the res_http_websocket.so
   module of Asterisk through 13.23.0, 14.7.x through 14.7.7, and 15.x through
   15.6.0 and Certified Asterisk through 13.21-cert2. It allows an attacker to
   crash Asterisk via a specially crafted HTTP request to upgrade the
   connection to a websocket. (CVE-2018-17281)
