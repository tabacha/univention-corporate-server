desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Migration of virtual machines between incompatible CPUs can be prevented by
   setting the new UCR variable 'uvmm/vm/cpu/host-model' to either 'missing'
   or 'always': This modifies the XML description to include a description for
   the CPU of the host system for running virtual machines.
   If a CPU description is present, UVMM will check the target host for
   compatibility. The migration is aborted if the target host's CPU is not
   compatible.
   Virtual machines must be restarted to activate pending changes. UVMM
   monitors running virtual machines for reboot events and restarts them
   automatically.
