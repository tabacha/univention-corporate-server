desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk. When processing a
   SUBSCRIBE request, the res_pjsip_pubsub module stores the accepted formats
   present in the Accept headers of the request. This code did not limit the
   number of headers it processed, despite having a fixed limit of 32. If more
   than 32 Accept headers were present, the code would write outside of its
   memory and cause a crash. (CVE-2018-7284)
 * res_pjsip allows remote authenticated users to crash Asterisk (segmentation
   fault) by sending a number of SIP INVITE messages on a TCP or TLS
   connection and then suddenly closing the connection. (CVE-2018-7286)
 * When endpoint specific ACL rules block a SIP request, they respond with a
   403 forbidden. However, if an endpoint is not identified, then a 401
   unauthorized response is sent. This vulnerability just discloses which
   requests hit a defined endpoint. The ACL rules cannot be bypassed to gain
   access to the disclosed endpoints. (CVE-2018-12227)
 * There is a stack consumption vulnerability in the res_http_websocket.so
   module. It allows an attacker to crash Asterisk via a specially crafted
   HTTP request to upgrade the connection to a websocket. (CVE-2018-17281)
